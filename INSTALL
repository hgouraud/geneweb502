INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX or MACOSX MACHINES

For the compilation, you need the Objective Caml compiler installed
in your computer. The compilation works for several versions of ocaml.
You also need the preprocessor camlp5.

They freely distributed at address:
     http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
     http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/camlp5/

1- In the top directory, do:
      ./configure

2- If the command ocamlc.opt is not installed, edit the file
   "tools/Makefile.inc" and change:
       OCAMLC=ocamlc.opt
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt.opt
   into
       OCAMLC=ocamlc
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt

3- If your platform has the command ocamlopt, do:
      make
   Otherwise do (warning: slower executables):
      make out

4- Do:
      make distrib

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied.

   This can constitute a "distribution" directory if you want to distribute
   executables.

5- To use GeneWeb, move the directory "distribution" to another place, or
   rename it.

   Go to this directory and launch the command "./gwsetup".

   The reason why it is better to move this directory is that "make clean"
   deletes it, and another "make distrib" overwrites it. If you created
   genealogic databases inside, they would be deleted.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS NT/95/98

You need:

- The Cygnus GNU-Win32 development tool, free (search in the Web)

- The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

- The Microsoft Assembler masm.

- The Objective Caml compiler.

- The Camlp5 preprocessor.

Follow the same instructions above than for the Unix installation.
