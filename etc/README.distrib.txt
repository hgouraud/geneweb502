To start with GeneWeb, you first need to execute some commands.

The simplest way is to launch the "gwsetup" program. It allows you to
execute these commands by using your Web browser. All is explained
in the navigation.

   Under Windows, double-click on "gwsetup".
   Under Unix, launch "gwsetup" in an xterm.
   Under MacOS X, launch "gwsetup" in a Terminal.

But if you prefer to know the basic commands of GeneWeb, and are used
to the interactive commands (MSdos, shell), go to the directory "gw"
and read the file README.txt. It is another way to start.
