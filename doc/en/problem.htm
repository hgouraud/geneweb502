Here are some frequently encountered problems with "gwd":

<p>

You launched the <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> daemon "gwd" and it answers normally
as indicated in the chapter "How to start with GeneWeb", section
"Command <a href="start.htm#Gwd">gwd</a>".

<p>

Then...

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>Message "socket failed"</font></h3>

Under Windows, if this message appears in the interactive window, and
you cannot connect with your navigator to the specified address, maybe
the internet protocol (TCP/IP) is not installed in your computer.

<p>

In this case, install it. It is in the "configuration panel", icon
"network".

<p>

Restart "gwd" afterwards and try again.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>Attempt to connect to the network</font></h3>

<ul><li>

When you enter the address in your navigator, e.g.:

<p>

<pre>
     http://localhost:2317/smith
</pre>

The navigator answers that you have to connect to the network, and that it
cannot work off line.

<p>

This problem happens with some versions of Internet Explorer.
</ul>

<ul><li>

Maybe depending on the navigator version, we received from
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> users (thank you) the following solutions:

<p>

<ul><li> Under Internet Explorer, select the menu "Display", "Internet
options".  Then, in menu "Connection", active "do not use proxy for
local addresses".</ul>

<p>

<ul><li> [Version 3.02] Under Internet Explorer, select the menu
"Display", "Options", "Connection". Then go to "Proxyserver" and
select "Setup", add under "Exceptions" and "Proxyserver not to be used
for addresses beginning with" the addresses given when you start
gwd.exe. For example (note the semicolons between names):
<pre>
     127.0.0.1;localhost;computer
</pre>
 </ul>

<p>

If it does not work better, we suggest you to use another navigator,
e.g. Netscape (which is free).
</ul>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>Cannot access file "start.txt"</font></h3>

<ul><li>Another frequent problem is the message: "Cannot access file
start.txt".</ul>

<ul><li>If you use <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> under Windows, maybe you
uncompressed the archive with "pkunzip". It is important to do it
with the options "-e -d":

<pre>
     pkunzip -e -d geneweb.zip
</pre>

If you did not uncompressed it like this, do it again with the good
options.

</ul>
