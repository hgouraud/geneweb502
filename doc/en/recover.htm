Installing a new version of <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>,
you probably want to continue using your database.

<p>

If you are not a specialist of interactive commands, use the program
<b><a href="gwsetup.htm">gwsetup</a></b> which tells you how to do
that (you can ignore the rest of the present chapter).

<p>

Otherwise, here is the way to do it by interactive commands.

<p>

If you started from a GEDCOM file, and you did not make modifications,
or very few of them, the better is to restart by launching the new
version of "ged2gwb". From a version to another, this program may have
been improved: new treated fields, new options.

<p>

On the other hand, if you had started from an empty base or from a
GEDCOM file and you made modifications, follow the following
procedure:

<ul>

<li> Move your base from the directory of the old version of <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>
to the new one. If your base's name is "smith", this is the directory
"smith.gwb" you have to move.

<li> Launch the new "gwd" and look if your base is accepted or not by
trying to consult it in the navigator.

<li> If it is not, you must recreate it. Do the following operations:

<ul>

<li>
Put "smith.gwb" back in the old directory

<li>
Launch a window of interactive commands. Go to the old directory (command "cd")
and type:

<pre>
     gwu smith.gwb > foo.gw
</pre>

Remark: this command was named "gwb2gw" in previous versions. If you have
it with this name, use it.

<li>
Copy the file "foo.gw" in the new directory.

<li>
In the window of interactive commands, go to the new directory (command "cd")
and type:

<pre>
     gwc -nc foo.gw -o smith
</pre>

<li>
Launch the new daemon and check that your base is accepted. It should be.

<li>
You can now delete the file "foo.gw" and "foo.gwo", this last one being
created by "gwc", became unuseful. But you can also keep "foo.gw" as
a save of your base.

</ul>
</ul>
