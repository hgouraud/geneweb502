This part explains the concepts of "consanguinity" and "relationship"
used by <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> and how they are computed.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>Consanguinity and Relationship</font></h3>

The genom of an individual consists of a great number of genes which,
if mutations are ignored, reproduce identically. The genes can be used
to measure the identity of a person.

<p>

The genes are placed in precise locations named "locus". Each
individual has for each locus two genes, one transmitted by his
mother, the other by his father, and transmits to his children a copy
of the one of his genes.

<p>

The <em>Consanguinity</em> of an individual <em>x</em> is the
probability <em>cg(x)</em> to find in a given locus two identical
genes.

<p>

The <em>Relationship</em> of two individuals <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
is the probability <em>pr(x, y)</em> to find in the same locus two
identical genes.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>Computations</font></h3>

A probability calculus shows that:

<ul><li>The consanguinity <em>cg(x)</em> is equal to the relationship
<em>pr(px,mx)</em> of the parents <em>px</em> and <em>mx</em> of
<em>x</em>.</ul>

<p>

<ul><li>If <em>x..a..y</em> is a minimal relationship link between
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (i.e. such as the branches <em>x..a</em> and
<em>a..y</em> have just <em>a</em> in common), then it contributes to
the relationship of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> of a factor:

<pre>
      1
     ---- (1 + cg a)
      n+1
     2
</pre>

where <em>n</em> is the length (distance <em>x..a</em> + distance
<em>a..y</em>) of the relationship link <em>x..a..y</em>.

<p>

The relationship of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is the sum of the
contributions of all their minimal relationship links.

</ul>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400>GeneWeb</font></h3>

<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> displays the consanguinity and the relationship in
the form of a percentage.

<p>

Statistically, on the great number of locuses of an individual, the
consanguinity corresponds approximately to the percentage of his
locuses holding identical genes.

<p>

The algorithms of consanguinity and relationship were written by
Didier R&eacute;my, director of research at INRIA. We thank him for
that.
