GeneWeb - Links to a database

This page indicates how to put links to {GeneWeb} pages. It is
written as well for the users of {GeneWeb} as to those which,
without knowing {GeneWeb}, wish to put direct links to
{GeneWeb} pages found on the Web.

<p>

Read it carefully, because there are a small pitfall to avoid and a
provided solution.


==Links with numbers ==

It is absolutely possible to put links to {GeneWeb} pages in
your bookmarks or HTML pages.

<p>

For example, you displayed the personal page of "John Smith" of the
base you are consulting. You note that it corresponds to the address:

<pre>
   http://machine:2317/foo?i=357
</pre>

<p>

The "357" you see in the request corresponds to a number which was
been attributed to "John Smith" by the utilities of {GeneWeb}
(ged2gwb, gwc or gwd).

<p>

If the person responsible for this base (yourself or someone else)
decides to update it, the numbers may change, and the link which you
will have recorded will not work any more.

<p>

For the persons in charge of {GeneWeb} bases, know that it
occurs:

<ul>

<li>By the command "ged2gwb" if you start from a new GEDCOM file.

<li>By the command "gwc" if you clean up the database.

</ul>


==Remedy ==

For avoid that, add to the address the following sequence:
"<tt>;opt=no_index</tt>", i.e., for the example above:

<pre>
   http://machine:2317/foo?i=357;opt=no_index
</pre>

<p>

Enter this address. {GeneWeb} will answer you the page:

<pre>
Link to use

 * http://machine:2317/foo?....
</pre>

<p>

This link is clickable (click on it), you must obtain the same page
(here the personal page of John Smith), but with an address not
containing any number but explicit references to his first name and
surname.

<p>

Use that address in your links.

<p>

This applies to all the requests of {GeneWeb}, particularly
with those displaying the relationship links where it is frequent to
find 2 or 3 persons of the base coded by their number.

<p>

For the owners of {GeneWeb} bases, also use this procedure in
the associated files: see the [[[pcustom/customization]]]
of pages.
